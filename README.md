# Transformers for text analysis

The repository contains transformer models for text analysis.
The work can be organized in the following sequence (pipeline):
* Spam filter
* Toxic filter
* Sentimental analysis and topic modeling


## Spam filter

## Toxic filter

### Files:

* `toxic_classifier.py` - contains function `get_toxic_classifier()`, which loads weights and returns a classifier.
It can be used for inference.

    Weights should be downloaded manually from
[google disk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15oZMdAwQ5U3xUnSmyNIhr5wE1bY0Nrys/view?usp=sharing).

* `training.ipynb` - contains training and validation. In the end of the notebook, the performance of the model
was compared with baseline model.

## Sentimental analysis

## Topic modeling
